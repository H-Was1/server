Certainly! Below is a Markdown code block that describes the routes in your backend API, including the relevant HTTP methods, endpoints, request bodies, and example responses.

### Markdown Code Block for API Routes

```markdown
## API Endpoints

### GET /

Returns a welcome message.

**Response:**
```
{
    "message": "Server is running"
}
```

### POST /openai/generate

Generates a response from OpenAI based on the provided prompt.

**Request Body:**
```
{
    "prompt": "Your prompt here"
}
```

**Response:**
```
{
    "choices": [
        {
            "message": {
                "role": "assistant",
                "content": "Response from OpenAI"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Error Handling

Errors are handled globally in the application. The server will respond with appropriate HTTP status codes and messages. For example:

- **400 Bad Request**: Returned when required fields are missing in a request.
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Returned when there is an unexpected error on the server.
```
